Artifical Emotional Intelligence or Emotion AI is a branch of AI that allows the computer to understand human non-verbal cues such as body language and facial experssion

The aim of the project is to classify peopleâ€™s emotion based on their facial expression. Collected more than 20000 facial images, with associated facial expression labels and around 2000 images with facial key points annotation. Like to thank Kaggle for giving this wonderful dataset
